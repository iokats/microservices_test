= Getting Started

== Project Set UP
We created the project with the following gradle command: `gradle init`

Please, have a look into the following references:

== Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It simplifies application
deployment by providing a consistent environment across different systems. With Docker, developers can build, test,
and deploy applications quickly and efficiently, improving collaboration and productivity.

=== Docker Architecture
Docker architecture consists of six main components: server, client, container, image, volume and registry.

1. **Docker Server** typically refers to the Docker Engine, which is the core component of the Docker platform
responsible for creating and managing containers. It provides an API and command-line interface (CLI) for interacting 
with containers, allowing users to build, run, and manage containerized applications. The Docker Engine runs as a daemon 
process on the host operating system and manages container lifecycle, networking, storage, and other container-related 
tasks.
2. The **Docker Client** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool used to interact with the Docker Engine, allowing users to 
build, run, and manage Docker containers. It sends commands to the Docker Engine via its REST API, enabling users to 
perform various tasks such as creating, starting, stopping, and inspecting containers, as well as managing Docker images, 
networks, volumes, and more. The Docker Client provides a simple and intuitive interface for developers and 
administrators to work with Docker containers and related resources.
3. A **Docker Container** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run a 
software application, including code, runtime, system libraries, and dependencies. Containers provide a consistent and 
isolated environment for running applications, allowing them to be easily deployed across different systems without 
changes. Docker containers are portable, scalable, and efficient, making them ideal for packaging, shipping, and 
deploying applications in various environments, from development to production.
4. A **Docker Image** is a preconfigured template that specifies what should be included in a Docker container. Usually, 
images are downloaded from websites like Docker Hub. However, it’s also possible to create a custom image with the help 
of Dockerfile.
5. The **Docker Registry** is a central repository that stores and manages Docker images. It is a server-based system that 
lets users store and share Docker images with others, making it easy to distribute and deploy applications. The most 
notable Docker registry is Docker Hub.
6. **Docker Volumes** are a feature that allows data to persist beyond the lifespan of a container. They provide a way 
to manage and store data separately from the container's filesystem, enabling data sharing between containers and between 
the host machine and containers. Volumes are commonly used for storing databases, log files, configuration files, and other 
persistent data in Dockerized applications. They offer flexibility, scalability, and performance benefits, making them 
essential for building reliable and scalable container-based systems

=== Persistence
https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-spring-boot-kotlin?tab=readme-ov-file#persistence-with-jpa[The Spring official guide]
says we shouldn't use kotlin data class with spring-data-jpa.
====
Here we don’t use data classes with val properties because JPA is not designed to work with immutable classes or the
methods generated automatically by data classes. If you are using other Spring Data flavor, most of them are designed
to support such constructs so you should use classes like data class User(val login: String, …) when using Spring
Data MongoDB, Spring Data JDBC, etc.]

==== Working with Spring Data Repositories
The goal of the Spring Data repository abstraction is to significantly reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to
implement data access layers for various persistence stores. For more details, please have a look into the following 
reference:

* https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories[Working with Spring Data Repositories]

==== No-arg compiler plugin
We added the https://kotlinlang.org/docs/no-arg-plugin.html[No-arg plugin] for generating an additional zero-argument
constructor for classes with a specific annotation. This allows the Java Persistence API (JPA) to instantiate a class, 
although it doesn't have the zero-parameter constructor from Kotlin or Java point of view.

==== Enabling DuplicateKeyException in MongoDB
We have to add the following spring data configuration: `spring.data.mongodb.auto-index-creation=true`
Because in Spring Data MongoDB, automatic index creation is turned off by default.

==== Enabling the OptimisticLockingFailureException in MySQL
We have to add the following spring data configuration: `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create`

==== Testcontainer
Testcontainers is a Java library that provides lightweight, disposable containers for integration testing. It allows 
developers to define and manage Docker containers directly within their test code, making it easy to set up isolated 
environments for testing against external dependencies such as databases, message brokers, and web services. Testcontainers 
automates the container lifecycle, handling container creation, startup, and teardown, ensuring consistent and reliable 
test environments. It supports a wide range of containerized technologies and integrates seamlessly with popular testing 
frameworks like JUnit and TestNG. Overall, Testcontainers simplifies the process of writing and running integration tests 
by providing fast, reproducible, and portable test environments.
